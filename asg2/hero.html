    <h1>Batman</h1>
    <h2>Publication history</h2>
    <h3>Creation and early history</h3>
	  <p>In early 1939, following the success of Superman, DC Comics' editors requested more superheroes.<br>
         Bob Kane created Batman, initially drawing a character with red tights, bat wings, and a domino mask.<br> 
		 Bill Finger, a collaborator, made significant contributions by suggesting a cowl, cape, gloves, and a darker costume.<br>
		 The character's alter ego, Bruce Wayne, was inspired by historical figures Robert the Bruce and Mad Anthony Wayne.<br>
		 Batman's early adventures drew inspiration from contemporary pulp fiction and characters like Zorro and the Shadow,<br>
		 establishing Batman as a master detective with a dark, brooding persona driven by the murder of his parents.

	  <h3>Golden, Silver and Bronze Ages</h3>
	    <pv>Batman debuted in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. Early stories were dark, featuring a Batman who did not shy away from killing.<br>
		    The character quickly became popular, leading to his own solo title in 1940. Robin, Batman's sidekick, was introduced in 1940,<br>
		    lightening the tone and boosting sales. Over the next few years, Batman's rogues' gallery expanded with iconic villains like the Joker and Catwoman.<br>
		    The 1950s saw Batman in lighter, science fiction-influenced stories. However, declining sales led to a 1964 revamp by editor Julius Schwartz, who<br>
		    returned Batman to his detective roots and updated his appearance. The 1966 Batman TV series introduced a campy, humorous tone, which was reflected in<br>
		    the comics until its cancellation in 1968. In the 1970s, writers Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams restored Batman's dark, gritty nature, a trend that<br>
		    continued despite fluctuating sales.

	  <h3>Modern Age and reboots</h3>
	    <pv>In the Modern Age of Comic Books Batman comics have undergone significant transformations, reflecting changing storytelling trends and audience interests.<br>
			Beginning with seminal works like The Dark Knight Returns in the 1980s, which reintroduced Batman in a grittier, more mature context, the character's<br>
			narrative evolved to explore deeper themes and darker tones. This period also saw the exploration of Batman's origins and psyche through works<br>
			like Batman: Year One, and Batman: The Killing Joke, which delved into the complexities of heroism and villainy. In the 1990s, storylines such as "Knightfall"<br>
			introduced new adversaries like Bane, who physically and mentally challenged Batman, leading to a temporary replacement by Jean-Paul Valley. The aftermath of<br>
			an earthquake in "No Man's Land" depicted Gotham City in chaos, further pushing Batman to new limits of heroism and survival. Entering the 21st century,<br>
			Grant Morrison's influential run introduced Damian Wayne as Batman's son and heir, bringing familial dynamics and a new generation of challenges to the forefront.<br>
			Morrison's storytelling also delved into surreal and existential themes, such as in Batman R.I.P. and Final Crisis, which tested Batman's resolve and sanity<br>
			against cosmic threats and personal demons.The New 52 reboot in 2011 refreshed Batman's continuity while preserving core elements of his character.<br>
			This era introduced modern interpretations of classic storylines, like Night of the Owls, where Batman confronts the Court of Owls, a clandestine society<br>
			controlling Gotham for centuries. The chilling return of the Joker in "Death of the Family" explored the intricate relationships within Batman's extended family<br>
			of allies and adversaries. More recent developments under DC Rebirth and Infinite Frontier have continued to evolve Batman's universe, exploring new characters like<br>
			Gotham and Gotham Girl, and tackling contemporary issues within the context of Gotham City's ever-evolving landscape of crime and heroism.
