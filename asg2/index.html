    <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
    <h4>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h4>
      <pv>Structured content describes the way or methods any particular clust of data or information<br>
          is found by algorithms. To be a bit more specific, it is one of the first things that<br>
          that AI voice assistants tend to look for to help a particular relating item to a consumers<br>
          inquiry, or key collection of terms that organize needed information to be grouped up<br>
          to be displayed immediately. On the other end, semantic HTML also describes the way information<br>
          is displayed, however, it makes more emphasis on the webpage itself on how it visually presents<br>
          itself to allow a meaningful relationship with the consumer who is viewing it. It can often<br>
          aid consumers to locate particular things in sections and different areas on a website easily,<br>
          given that each element in HTML is clearly split up</pv>
    <h4>How do they work together?</h4>
       <p>Often when AI voice assitants or algorithms try to find inquries for a consumer to look at, the search<br>
          engine will pull up links based on key words or organized clusters of key information needed to satisfy<br>
          the consumer. Some of these would include a specific list of songs that were listed as most popular on a website.<br>
          HTML would list those songs in a very particular way in code that it makes it very visually obvious where the list is.<br>
          Structured content would allow algorithims to then find that list and allow that website to be one of the first sources<br>
          to pop up as results given the key words and content.</p>
    <h4>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h4>
      <p>Often times there will be a mixup with AI voice assistants where the search will not result in the particular answer<br>
         that you require because of the way that structured content may prioritize key words that have particular qualities<br>
         in the code. This is why both are needed. A poorly designed website with visually unappealing organization will mess<br>
         with the structured content, given there is a mess of what to focus on, search engines will struggle to show the quick<br>
         answers that a user needs. Having a website having good design will for one allow a consumer to find things easier, but<br>
         also allow optimization for search engines to know what is important to focus on when results are being pulled up or what<br>
        particular cluster of information gets intially displayed without the full website being open</p>

      <h2>Part 4</h2>
		<p>1. I feel that in Denise's methods of fighting off your inner critic, the "Give yourself some props" one resonates<br>
		   with myself very well. I struggle with low confidence and have a hypercritical outlook on my artistic or general work.<br>
		   Having a more positive outlook has actualy made me feel better about myself and my work sometimes in the past. Though I don't<br>
		   find the method to be consistent, it has helped me over the years.
		</p>
        <br>
		<p>2. Hyperbolic discounting describes the behavior we follow as we have situations in which we are met with an option to choose<br>
		   to do a task now or do that task later because theres always later. More specifically, it describes our tendencey to rather choose the<br>
		    comfort of pushing things to the future, putting tasks and goals for later instead of doing them now.<br>
		    To quote McRaney in his article, "The trick is to accept the now you will not be the person facing those choices,<br>
			it will be the future you – a person who can’t be trusted." This is not so much a method, rather a mindset that strongly<br>
			resonated with me. It perfectly encapsulates the inevitability of time and the future. Having the mindset of pushing everything<br>
			to future-you will only hurt present-you later down the line. Almost like a scare tactic, it's almost like it intimidates yourself<br>
		    to be better for your present-you and future-you not to work towards bettering the tendencies.</p>
		<br>
        <p>3. I find my work and myself being drawn towards the "Networking Power" type. Having always being involved with people, I deeply care<br>
		   for who or what is included in digital works and connection with others. It also feels personal to get to know others through work.</p>
