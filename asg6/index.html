		<h1>Six Thinking Hats</h1>
        <h2>White Hat</h2>
          <p class="condensed">
            Thinking about what information is available for myself to use is one of the first things I need to consider when looking into this project. I recognize that all currently available content I would want to display on my project already exists on locally active preexisting libraries and websites. Such information mostly consists around the bounds of marine biological research and papers. The method in which to get this kind of information is limited to the fact that some research is unconcluded, especially when it revolves around international research from many experts/biologists around the globe. However, these same people would be the first line in terms of gathering the information that is available to use.
          </p>
      <h2>Red Hat</h2>
          <p class="condensed">
		    Something that excites me in particular is the action of knowledge being shared. It is a very human right to learn and access information. While my project focuses very heavily on marine biology, that is still a massive aspect of our worlds composition and is important to catalogue. I assume this project will allow information to not only be learned but also shared with others with ease; seeing it as a form of international networking if you will. The scale in which this succeeds depends on how popular the project actually becomes, which would be disheartening. The complete opposite were to hold true if the project was popular, and people used it frequently.
          </p>
      <h2>Black Hat</h2>
          <p class="condensed">
			I feel that most aspects of the project work well together, if I was forced to give an answer, the aspect of wanting some form of networking to be functional in the project. It is not a guarantee that a form of social platform would blend well with a place that acts like a library, especially with the constraints of cybersecurity and online safety. This would technically fall in line to be one of the projects first problems as well. Another glaring issue would be not the project itself, rather, the very nature of its existence. Such a project requires a kickstarter, otherwise. it would be absolutely drowned in the sea of other websites that exist, it needs the public attention to be seen and supported for it to actually gain some traction. A downside that this project faces is the very nature of the website being a digital library. Google exists, and with that an infinitely faster library, this project exists as a more specialized and specific library, but realistically, a slower Google. 
		  </p>
      <h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
          <p class="condensed">
			While Google may be a faster alternative to my project, what my project allows is for all the topics of similiar subject matter to be all under one roof. All the information needed for the particular subject in mind, in this case being marine biology related, would all be in one place. And for this to actually succeed, it would need a community, a large group of people who recognize that it is beneficial to have a trustworthy site with credible research on.
		  </p>
      <h2>Green Hat</h2>
          <p class="condensed">
			Aside from the site being essentially a very large digital library for a specifc subject. I see this extending to be a method of communication among the masses, not in the sense like conventional social media but a place where research and science can be passed around and discussed. This can extend to the idea of making a portion of this project like a social forum where others can discuss and review research. The obvious issue with this is that there must be an initial blast of traffic to get this started, a need to contact an uncountable amount of people overtime to gather a community.
		  </p>
      <h2>Blue Hat</h2>
          <p class="condensed">
			The main subject of this project will be marine biological research, dividing studies in the different levels of the oceanic levels. I see this as a centralized research resource, a library if you will. It's purpose would be to educate in a specific place, a place where it is somewhat discouraged to speak of off-topic conversations. Of course, I am not certain on how that would be enforced if at all, as if this becomes a site where people are allowed to freely speak then regulations would be difficult.
		  </p>
	 <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
		  <div class="text-with-image">
		  <p class="condensed">
			 It comes to my understanding that this project is limited in its success. Many fronts of its humble beginnings stems from the fact that I will need to contact many people for this to actually function the way I want to. And these people would have to be a massive range of normal everyday people of the masses, to the highest level of experts in the field. A large amount of networking will be required for such large amounts of published/unpublished research to be used to a public settings. Some of these cases may include people who refuse to release their research in this manner, or for the sake of copyright or other laws. This promptly brings me to the other takeaway of this dicussion. I need to heavily focus on the great organization of mass quantity of information. I am essentially making a new library, that means millions of bits of information being carefully organized where they should go and how they are accessible both to the production team of the project and the commonfolk who are there to learn and actually test-run the site.
