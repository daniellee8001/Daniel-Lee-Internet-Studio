	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>In the first reading, I learned about the different practices of web design that will be taught in the following chapters.
	In the second reading, I understood that the evolution of technology is moving from information that is copied to information
	that an indivudal owns and is transfered. In the last reading, it was interesting to see that there is slowly a trend of the
	return for the desire to own information rather than to just create and copy.

	<h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
	<p>I've always had an interest in Marine Biology, and always loved watching animal documentaries or TV shows about animals
		as a child. It was always fun to browse the web to find more information about differing creatures and facts about them,
		however, I find the effort to be difficult to navigate through the vast amount of articles I would need to jump to alongside 
		the need to not always not exactly what to search for regarding particular relating subjects to sea-creatures. I want to
		envision a website that can be used as a digitial library of sorts that houses various bountiful amounts of information through
		visual hyperlinks, or organized in vast categories to aid in searching for topics or relating topics involving Marine biology.
		This could also encourage others to explore since there is an "uncountable" amount of information in one place, similiar to how
		one might react being put in a library for the first time.
