<h2>Why this band is my favorite</h2>
		   <p>Twice being my favorite is actually a very new development in my life. It mostly<br>
		      started due to my peers loving their music, and I would occasionally chime in and listen<br>
		      with them. I realized over time that their style of music was enticing and a pleasant groove. <br>
		      A massive development in my favoritism for this group happened with the arrival of the movie<br>
		      Kpop Demon Hunters. This movie showcased songs both written and performed by some of the Twice<br>
		      members, more specifically, Jeongyeon, Jihyo, and Chaeyoung. The songs were so massively empowering<br>
		      and addicting to listen to. The music wouldn't be the calmest of tones, rather a very upbeat and exciting<br>
		      experience. The songs played for the movie have been stuck in my head for ages.
