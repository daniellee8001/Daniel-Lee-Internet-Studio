			Allowing a project to flow like a story firstly allows ideas to follow a more narrative structure. A this happens then this comes after because of that. Having a framework in this manner allows yourself to see a more chronological path for your project alongside actually garnering attention from others. When we give a project story, we give it emotions and life, therefore feeding it to allow its interest to grow and its emotional weight and impact on yourself and others grow. It gives a reason for people to care or want to support it. It gives it meaning. Allowing to have more direction and purpose allows an individual to hone in and refine their ideas more because of the visable path you have now given yourself. It is not simply a goal that needs to be accomplished, it becomes the why is this goal needed, what does it accomplish, why is it successful, why would others like it. It allows the individual to ask more and think more.<br><br>
