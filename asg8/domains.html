        Some of the responses received about the domain name suggestions is their mutual characteristic of being uniquely chosen to fit my project well. One comment stands out saying how interesting the first option was, given its nature to be very flexible it its meaning and weight. Speaking about a website that describes unity in oceanic studies. Some other comments revolve around the fun wordplay of the third option. Leaving the second option still liked and thought as creative, yet remained the option with the least feedback. This possibly might be due to its greek word origins, may be confusing to some people.

        <h2>Aimed Domain Name</h2>

            I think the domain name I think will serve my purpose the best is the first option "Oceunity". I expressed my desire for this project to be a place where information could be shared and learned, a place where international borders would be meaningless for the sake of biological research, a sense of unity to be formed, matched well with my theme and of course the final name for the domain. A website very obviously being about the ocean and its far reaching studies of science and biology, alongside the concept of allowing the formation of connection of knowledge among the masses.
