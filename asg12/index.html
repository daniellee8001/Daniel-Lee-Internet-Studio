	  <h1 class="page-title">Why these movies mean so much to me</h1>
	  <p class="summary-text">Each of these movies made up a massive chunk of my interests growing up, or even the interests I still do have or have come to love now. They are a mixture of my child young self experiencing such joy and wonder from these worlds from these movies that I had come to hold dearly. Many parts of these movies make up my humor, my interests in life, my preference in style of storytelling and medium I like to watch in. It is not the perfect list because a few do shift around here and there, but for some of the older ones, they remain some of the closest aspects of my being. From a child, to a teenager, to a young adult, they will always hold a soft spot in my heart for creating what I am today.</p>
