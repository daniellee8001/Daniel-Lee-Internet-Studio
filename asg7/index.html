        <h2>Running Mate: Mitsuri Kanroji</h2>

		<p>
			Mitsuri is one of Rengoku's oldest students, and is a powerful swordswoman and is a skilled tactician. She does not command as much leadership as Rengoku, however, has a massive compassionate heart for others. This makes her a leader that represents the people very well. She sees the faults or falls of people and supports them emotionally and will lead in a way that is more oriented towards the actual social aspect of leadership, rather than sheer physical action like Rengoku. She is a very kind and cheerful individual that allows her positive energy to bleed onto others.

            <h2>Campaign Platform: New Stronger Leadership</h2>
            <p>
				Rengoku would not necessarily takeover the previous leader by force. In this world, the prior-existing leaadership members would die from young age from a sickness that is passed down by a curse. This shows that though leaders may be successful, it is discouraging to have so many leaders die so young and are weak from sickness. To ensure a strong stable leader, Rengoku yearns to establish a stronger presense as top brass in the Demon Slayer Corps to envoke confidence in their fellow swordsmen and to ensure that the Corps stays strong with his high level and efficient training and tactical organization.
